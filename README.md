# Paid Source

Give copies, sell ownership. An experiment in value logistics for source available software and digital goods.

Sell the right to say "I own this" and it to be true. Free the free copies, and turn them into leads for your next sale. 

- $x for an individual to own a copy.
- $y for a business to own a copy.
- $z for help and other services.

You're a business if it's a business expense.

Owners can do anything except misrepresent origin, identity, or authorship of their copy.

Copies may be freely redistributed, but ownership is non-transferable, and can only be sold by the author. 

Ownership may come with further perks. Referral kickbacks optional.

# Background

Almost all transactions have no legal or government intervention or support. You could sue, they could sue, but we won't. Even shoplifters walk. So licenses and copyright laws really are meaningless to most of us. Whether you own it, they'll steal it. 

But, those that pay will pay, if you propose something. A value proposition.

It helps to know the psychology and logistics of value. With most free software and digital content, not only is paying inconvenient, but the consumer already has the product. The transaction already happened. There is no value proposition left, beyond donations.

The innovation with selling digital copies hasn't come with new laws and policing, but value logistics. 

The registration key system sells the keys, not the software. The key then unlocks features. The subscription system sells access. And larger businesses have always paid for support, training, and less liabilty.

Paid source is about value logistics. Use it as a convenient way to get paid for your work, for both the buyer and you.



# Buying

The buyer pays the author a one time price for ownership of a copy and proof of purchase.

The buyer will not misrepresent origin, identity, or authorship of the copy.

The buyer may distribute copies, and recipients can decide whether they purchase ownership from the author.

# Selling

The author must maintain a listing with a way to buy the product.





# Just Like Books

Software, when packaged, has always sold like books.

No one pays for closed books and financial books don't charge based on financial gains. And when you buy a book, that physical copy is yours. You can sell it, lend it, burn it, or give it away. You can even copy it. You own the book. 

What you can't do is sell copies or pretend you wrote the book or plagiarize. But for all practical intent and purposes, the copy of that book is yours.

Most books, like software, are also written by single authors, and are a labor of love.

Paid source is the equivalent of books for digital goods, including software, and digital books.
