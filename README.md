# Paid Source

A model for selling source available software and digital goods.

- $x for an individual to own a copy.
- $y for a business to own a copy.
- $z for help and other services.

Owners can do anything except misrepresent origin, identity, or authorship of their copy.

Copies may be freely redistributed, but ownership is non-transferable and can only be sold by the author.

If you are claiming the purchase as a business expense, you are a business.

# Background

Almost all transactions have no legal or government intervention or support. You could sue, but you won't. They could sue, but they won't. And they don't even arrest shoplifters anymore. Transactions of small amounts just are not worth it.

So whether you realized it or not, most licenses and copyright and ip laws really are meaningless. Whether open source or proprietary, those that pay will pay, those that don't won't, and the decision will mostly be based on convenience and the nature of the transaction.

With most free software and digital content, not only is paying inconvenient, but the consumer already has the product. The transaction already happened. There is no value proposition left, beyond donations.

The innovation with selling digital copies hasn't come with new laws and policing, but value logistics. 

The registration key system sells the keys, not the software. The key then unlocks features. 

The subscription system sells access. Without access, you cannot use the software.

And enterprises have always paid for customer service and training.

Paid source offers a simple value logistics template.


# Buying

The buyer pays the author a one time price for ownership of a copy and proof of purchase.

The buyer will not misrepresent origin, identity, or authorship of the copy.

The buyer may distribute copies, and recipients can decide whether they purchase ownership from the author.

# Selling

The author must maintain a listing with a way to buy the product.





# Just Like Books

Software, when packaged, has always sold like books.

No one pays for closed books and financial books don't charge based on financial gains. And when you buy a book, that physical copy is yours. You can sell it, lend it, burn it, or give it away. You can even copy it. You own the book. 

What you can't do is sell copies or pretend you wrote the book or plagiarize. But for all practical intent and purposes, the copy of that book is yours.

Most books, like software, are also written by single authors, and are a labor of love.

Paid source is the equivalent of books for digital goods, including software, and digital books.
