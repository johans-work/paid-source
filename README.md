# Paid Source

A model for selling source available software and digital goods.

# Background

Almost all transactions have no legal or government intervention or support. You could sue, but you won't. They could sue, but they won't. Transactions of small amounts just are not worth it.

So whether you realized it or not, licensing really is meaningless. Whether you adopt a fancy open source license, a dual license, or a restrictive proprietary license, those that pay will pay, those that don't won't, and the decision will mostly be based on convenience and emotion.

The problem with most free software projects is not only is paying inconvenient, but the consumer already has the product. There is no value proposition there, beyond donations. The same can be said about blogs. Even with the best content, the reader may have already read it, and paying is an inconvenient choir. And if the price is cheap, why even bother? 

But the good news is, transactions never required legal legitimacy. 

They only require logistics of value.


# Buying

The buyer pays the author a one time price for ownership of a copy and proof of purchase.

The buyer will not misrepresent origin, identity, or authorship of the copy.

The buyer may distribute copies, and recipients can decide whether they purchase ownership from the author.

# Selling

The author must maintain a listing with a way to buy the product.





# Just Like Books

No one pays for closed books and financial books don't charge based on financial gains. And when you buy a book, that physical copy is yours. You can sell it, lend it, burn it, or give it away. You can even copy it. You own the book. 

What you can't do is sell copies or pretend you wrote the book or plagiarize. But for all practical intent and purposes, the copy of that book is yours.

Most books, like software, are also written by single authors, and are a labor of love.

Paid source is the equivalent of books for digital goods, including software, and digital books.
