# Paid Source

A way to sell ownership of source available software and digital goods.

# Background

There is a grave misunderstanding of the legal system and of transactions in general, especially when it comes to commerce.

There is little to no litigation against consumers that steal or don't pay or commit petty fraud. Not even shoplifting anymore. And not even by the IRS for taxes. The government simply does not have the resources, nor the interest, to go after such cases, beyond scare tactics.

In other words, almost all transactions have no legal or government intervention or support. But the good news is, they never required it.

We are perfectly capable of making an honest transaction, and we pay our taxes one way or the other. Fulfilling a social contract is common sense for most of us.



# Buying

The buyer pays the author a one time price for ownership of a copy and proof of purchase.

The buyer will not misrepresent origin, identity, or authorship of the copy.

The buyer may distribute copies, and recipients can decide whether they purchase ownership from the author.

# Selling

The author must maintain a listing with a way to buy the product.





# Just Like Books

No one pays for closed books and financial books don't charge based on financial gains. And when you buy a book, that physical copy is yours. You can sell it, lend it, burn it, or give it away. You can even copy it. You own the book. 

What you can't do is sell copies or pretend you wrote the book or plagiarize. But for all practical intent and purposes, the copy of that book is yours.

Most books, like software, are also written by single authors, and are a labor of love.

Paid source is the equivalent of books for digital goods, including software, and digital books.
