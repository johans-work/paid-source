# The Paid Source License

A standardized value proposition for the ownership of source available software and digital copiable products, for anyone struggling to monetize their work.

# Books

No one would pay for a closed book. Financial books don't charge based on the financial gains of the reader. And when you buy a book, that book is yours. You can copy it, sell it, lend it, burn it, or give it away. You own the book. 

What you're not allowed to do is sell copies or pretend you wrote the book or plagiarize. But for all practical intent and purposes, the copy of that book is yours.

Most books, like software, are also written by single authors, and are a labor of love.
