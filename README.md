# Paid Source

A new convenient way to get paid for your digital work, for both the buyer and you. 

# How does it work?

Sell the right to say "I own this" and for it to be true. Give copies, sell ownership. Free the free copies, and turn them into leads for your next sale. 

# Why does it work?

Almost all transactions have no legal or government enforcement, and licenses and copyright laws really are meaningless to average consumers. Lawyers are only for big fish, and the police don't arrest consumers for lying their order was stolen. Bad actors exist, but they're a minority, and chalked up as the cost of doing business.

For most of us, we pay because we want to, and because we love ownership. We also recognize it's the right thing to do, and don't consider ourselves bad actors. We honor the transaction. 

Fear also does exist. However, beyond legal ramifications (which are mostly false), there is shame. There's public humiliation and being ashamed of stealing which happens within us, as does the thrill of getting away with it, for the bad actors among us.

The innovation with selling digital copies has always been with logistics, and not with policing or the law.

CDs and DVDs rely on plastic to sell copies. The registration key system sells the keys, not the software. The subscription system sells access. And larger businesses have always happily paid for support, training, and for decrease in liabilty.

Paid source is about value logistics. 

Use the keyword "ownership" to sell ownership, and give them more than they would receive through any other method.

You could sue, they could sue, but we won't. Even shoplifters walk. So  Whether you own it, they'll steal it. 

But, those that pay will pay, if you propose a deal - a value proposition.

With most free software and digital content, not only is paying inconvenient, but the consumer already has the product. The transaction already happened. There is no value proposition left, beyond donations. Hence, all the calls for donations.



# Is it open source?

The term "open source" is avoided to avoid conflicts with other definitions or politics. However, your source, and the work, is made available, visible, and free, even before any transactions take place.


# Basic Pricing Template

- $x for an individual to own a copy.
- $y for a business to own a copy.
- $z for help and other services.

You're a business if it's a business expense.

Owners can do anything except misrepresent origin, identity, or authorship of their copy.

Copies may be freely redistributed, but ownership is non-transferable, and can only be sold by the author. 

Ownership may come with further perks. 

Referral kickbacks optional.



# Buying

The buyer pays the author a one time price for ownership of a copy and proof of purchase.

The buyer will not misrepresent origin, identity, or authorship of the copy.

The buyer may distribute copies, and recipients can decide whether they purchase ownership from the author.

# Selling

The author must maintain a listing with a way to buy the product.





# Just Like Books

Software, when packaged, has always sold like books.

No one pays for closed books and financial books don't charge based on financial gains. And when you buy a book, that physical copy is yours. You can sell it, lend it, burn it, or give it away. You can even copy it. You own the book. 

What you can't do is sell copies or pretend you wrote the book or plagiarize. But for all practical intent and purposes, the copy of that book is yours.

Most books, like software, are also written by single authors, and are a labor of love.

Paid source is the equivalent of books for digital goods, including software, and digital books.
